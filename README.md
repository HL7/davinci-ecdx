FHIR IG Electronic Clinical Data Exchange

## View the IG

### (Current build (FHIR Version R4)](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-ecdx)

## scope

The scope of the CDex project is to defined combinations of exchange methods (push, pull, subscribe, â€¦), specific payloads (Documents, Bundles, and Individual Resources), search criteria, conformance, provenance, and other relevant requirements to support specific exchanges of clinical information between provider and other providers and/or payers. The goal is to identify, document and constrain very specific patterns of exchange so that providers and payers can reliably exchange information for patient care (including coordination of care), risk adjustment, quality reporting, identifying that requested services are necessary and appropriate (e.g. should be covered by the payer) and other uses that may be documented as part of this effort. Clinical data payloads will include C-CDA, C-CDA on FHIR, compositions, bundles, specific resources, and bulk data exchange. This list is intended to be illustrative and not prescriptive. The project will address patient consent where appropriate.
