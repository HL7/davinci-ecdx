## Use Case Description
Payers need to augment claims data to satisfy quality reporting requirements and improve quality care scores, and to reduce preventable medical errors. Currently, they gather this clinical information a minimum of twice per year, sometimes monthly. Receiving information more frequently would help improve scores. The information can come from any provider. However, it typically comes from outpatient providers who are network providers. Payers use a combination of claims and clinical info to assess care quality. The may use information gathered from HIEs if available to Payers. However, some auditing issues exist when getting data from an HIEs because more work is required for proper attestation. Information from the patients medical record can be used, as well as progress notes or visit summaries. C-CDAs of various types may be useful, but in this use case, Payers are more oriented toward specific data points. They are looking for Medications, lab results, Assessment for Diagnoses, vital signs (BP), and Narrative (clinical notes) that contain information that is pertinent to a quality measurement program.
