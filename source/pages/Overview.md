The Clinical Data exchange (CDex) Implementation Guide is part of the larger Da Vinci use case for Health Record exchange (HRex). The eHRx project consists of multiple independent efforts (and is tied to separate HL7 Prpject Scope Statements). Patient Care and Attachments to sponsor the work on e Clinical Data exchange (CDex). The exchange of Payer Data (PDex) is sponsored by Financial Management and the exchange of formulary information is sponsored by the Pharmacy Work Group. The exchange of Quality Measures was included in the existing work on the Data Exchange for Quality Measures (DEQM) that is sponsored by the CQI workgroup.  The overall HRex Framework is sponsored by the Clinical Interoperability Council (CIC), 

The CDex Implementation Guide defines combinations of exchange methods (push, pull, solicited communication and unsolicited communication, and subscribe), specific payloads (Documents, Bundles, and Individual Resources), search criteria, conformance, provenance, and other relevant requirements to support the exchanges of clinical information between provider and other providers and/or payers. The goal is to identify, document and constrain very specific patterns of exchange so that providers and payers can reliably exchange information for patient care (including coordination of care), risk adjustment, quality reporting, identifying that requested services are necessary and appropriate (e.g. should be covered by the payer) and other uses that may be documented as part of this effort. Clinical data payloads will include C-CDA, C-CDA on FHIR, compositions, bundles, specific resources, and bulk data exchange. This list is intended to be illustrative and not prescriptive.This project will reference, where possible the "standards" defined by the Health Record exchange (HRex) Framework Implementation Guide which in turn will utilize prior work.

The initial phase of the project specifies the use of RESTful exchange methods and the solicited and unsolicited communication mechanisms.  Subscription and bulk data methods will be developed next.
