## Use Case Description
Payers want to improve member experience by improving processes between the payer and provider so members have fewer issues, less waiting, better planning information, and more cost transparency. Access to clinical information allows the payer to have a more informed conversation with the member. This use case requires the payer to have real-time or ongoing access to information that is closely tied to the point of care. This isn't another ask that adds burden for providers. Its about using the existing clinical information shared with other care team members to make the total process of care (which includes payment) run more smoothly. As clinical information flows from the ordering provider to a servicing provider, or as documentation passes to a consulting providers to support care, this same clinical information can flow into payer systems to improve the members experience of care. (Note: Direct collection of Patient info is out of scope for this use case.)

## Examples
Payers need information that helps them meet new regulatory requirements that promote patient access and exchange of information.
