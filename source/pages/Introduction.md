The CDex Implementation Guide (IG) defines combinations of exchange methods (push, pull, subscribe, CDS Hooks), specific payloads (Documents, Bundles, and Individual Resources), search criteria, conformance, provenance, and other relevant requirements to support the exchanges of clinical information between provider and other providers and/or payers. 
The IG provides specific guidance showing patterns of exchange so that providers and payers can reliably exchange information for patient care (including coordination of care), risk adjustment, and quality reporting, and other uses that may be documented as part of this effort. 
Clinical data payloads include C-CDA, C-CDA on FHIR, compositions, bundles, specific resources, and bulk data exchange. This list is intended to be illustrative and not prescriptive.
##Background
The Clinical Data Exchange (CDex) IG is part of a set of IGs developed to support eHealth Record Exchange requirements identified by the Payer community.  The set of IGs includes the Da Vinci Health Record Exchange (HRex) IG which establishes a framework for supporting information exchange, the Payer Data Exchange (PDex) IG which focuses on exchanging data available in Payer systems, the Data Exchange for Quality Measures (DEQM) which establishes a framework for supporting quality measure data exchange, and the CDex IG which focuses on exchanging data available in Provider systems.
