## Use Case Description
Payers need to create complete, accurate risk profiles for members to support value-based care contracts and population health adjustments. They gather information for this purpose on an annual contracting basis, on a monthly basis, and update it as new claims are paid. Risk adjustments are submitted to CMS annually, but receiving this information after each visit would make it more useful. The information can come from any provider (a vist  at a time), but typically from outpatient providers and usually from network providers. Data needs to come from the Provider of Record, not from an aggregation created by an HIE. Medical records, a progress note or visit summary would be useful. C-CDAs of various types would be ideal when they include Medications, lab results, Assessment for Diagnoses, vital signs (BP), and Narrative (clinical notes).
