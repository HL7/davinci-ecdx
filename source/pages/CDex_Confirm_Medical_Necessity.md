## Use Case Description
Payers need clinical documentation to support prior authorization, claims processing, audit submitted claims, and to confirm medical necessity and appropriateness. The information is needed at the time prior authorization is requested, or during care planning. Clinical information may be needed asynchronously to support an audit or claims processing. It also is needed when providers are ordering a service. The information used when ordering the service needs to be shared with the provider referred to render the service because they need it to support the claim. Consulting providers may need to request additional information from the ordering physician in order to support their claim. The information can be supplied in a standard exchange document format such as a progress note, or encounter summary. However, in some cases, just a specific subset of information may be needed such as certain results from diagnostic testing including diagnosis codes, assessment and diagnoses, or records of certain treatments.
