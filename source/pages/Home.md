This is a pre-release version (Ballot 1) of Clinical Data exchange  (CDex) R1/STU. There is no current official version. 

This specification is currently undergoing ballot and FHIR Connectathon testing. It is expected to evolve, possibly significantly, as part of that process.

Feedback is welcome and may be submitted through the [FHIR gForge tracker](http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemAdd&tracker_id=677/) indicating US Da Vinci CDex as the specification. If balloting on this IG, please submit your comments via the tracker and reference the tracker item in your ballot submission.
