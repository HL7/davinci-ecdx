## Use Case Description
Sharing clinical information also supports providers as they place orders and  complete referrals for care. The receiving provider needs the order and supporting documentation as soon as it is signed. And the referring/ordering provider needs the results from the referral / order in a clinically significant time after the resulting work is completed.  There may be a need to receive intermediate information with each visit or at the end of some defined period for an extended process (e.g. home health). Initially, information comes from the ordering/referring  provider. Then, once services begin to be provided, information comes from the performing provider. The signed order/referral and documentation is needed to demonstrate medical necessity of the ordered services. This information must be supplied by the ordering provider to the performing provider so that the performing provider has what is needed to submit their claim for performing the services.
