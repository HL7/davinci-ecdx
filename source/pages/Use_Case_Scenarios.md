Use case scenarios set the scope and form the foundation for this Implementation Guide.  Each use case is designed around a benefit resulting from the information exchange interaction. The following use cases are addressed:

* Improve Care Coordination
* Collect More Accurate Risk Profiles
* Improve Support for Quality Management
* Confirm Medical Necessity More Efficiently
* Improve Memeber Experience
* Track Referrals and Orders More Effectively

Each Use Case includes an overall description. It provides technical specifications for one or more options showing how FHIR-based mechanisms can be used to accomplish the needed information exchange.
