## Common Code Systems Used in C-CDA and C-CDA on FHIR
### Code Systems
Several code systems are used by the C-CDA and C-CDA on FHIR, and US Core Implementation Guides.  A code system is ...[Todo add definition]

### Value Sets, Value Set Definitions, Value Set Expansions, and Value Set Bindings
A value set is a defined set of codes established for a specific data representation purpose and is used in a template of profiles to constrain the range of to be used in a structural component of the representational model. Value set definitions, when applied to a specific version of a code system result in a value set expansion that enumerates the list of applicable concepts available for use in a model bound to that value set. 

Vocabulary binding syntax controls the expectations of use for concepts available in the value set expansion.  [ToDo add links for more information].
