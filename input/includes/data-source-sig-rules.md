- When an electronic or digital signature is required for a Task-based request, the Data Source/Responder returns a document that is either already inherently signed or transforms it into a *signed* FHIR Document.
  - if multiple documents need to be signed, systems should minimize the number of interactions required by the user
- The Data Source/Responder follows the documentation on the [Signatures] page for producing signatures.
- As discussed in the [What is Signed] section, a signed FHIR document could have objects that are individually signed within it as well. If the Consumer/Requester assumed there would be a signature (wet, electronic, or digital) on an individual returned object (e.g CCDA, PDF, Image, CDA on FHIR ) and it is not present, they can *re-request* the data using a Task-based request to indicate it needs to be signed with the `Task.input` signature flag.
