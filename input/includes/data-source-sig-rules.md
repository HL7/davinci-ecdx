- When an electronic or digital signature is required for Task based request, the Data Source/Responder returns a document that is either already inherently signed or transform it into a  *FHIR Document* signed by the responding provider.
- The Data Source/Responder follows the documentation in the [Signatures] page for producing signatures.
- As discussed in the [What is Signed] section, a signed FHIR document could have objects that are individually signed within it as well. If the Consumer/Requester assumed there would be a signature (wet,electronic, or digital) on an individual returned object (e.g CCDA, PDF, Image, CDA on FHIR ) and it is not present, they can *re-request* the data using Task based request and indicate it needs to signed using the `Task.input` signature flag.
