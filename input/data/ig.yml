description: "This IG provides detailed guidance that helps implementers use FHIR-based\
    \ interactions and resources relevant to support specific exchanges of clinical\
    \ information between provider and payers (or other providers).  What is unique\
    \ about this guide is that is provides additional technical guidance on two FHIR\
    \ transaction approaches for requesting information:\n\n - Direct Query\n - Task\
    \ Based Approach:\n\nThe types of clinical and or administrative data is not limited to FHIR resources\
    \ but includes C-CDA documents, pdfs, text files and other types of data. There\
    \ may be requests for payloads of clinical records of care such as CCD Documents\
    \ (or [C-CDA on FHIR Documents](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/ccda/)),\
    \ clinical data sets that may be represented in a FHIR Bundle, and clinical data\
    \ such as a specific FHIR resource. By using the FHIR standard and implementing\
    \ this guide the quality of information shared can be improved.   Payers can be\
    \ explicit about the data they are requesting, as opposed to general requests\
    \ which often result in providers sending more information than might be necessary\
    \ to make sure claims are supported. Benefits resulting from the information exchange\
    \ interaction include:\n\n  - Improve care coordination\n  - Support risk adjustment\n\
    \  - Ease quality management\n  - Facilitate claims auditing\n  - Support claim adjudication\n\
    \ - Confirm medical necessity\n  - Support orders and referrals"
