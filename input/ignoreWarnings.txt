# ===  CDex needs a contained patient for 3 specific demographic elements US Core variance approved: https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-46780 ===

WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-cdex/StructureDefinition/cdex-patient-demographics').baseDefinition: US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Patient derive from the core US profile. See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CGP/US+Core+Variance+Request+Process

# ===  CDex needs a contained PractitionerRole to communicate the identifiers for both the provider practitioner and organization using Task.owner which is limited to max=1 reference. A Jira ticket has been lodged for Task to allow for >1 task.for element to address this issue.  This is the appropriate use of contained because the content referred to in the contained resource does not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains it.  Furthermore, US Core does not require but recommends that contained resource conform to US Core.  US Core variance approved: https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-46779 ===

WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-cdex/StructureDefinition/cdex-practitionerrole').baseDefinition: US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on PractitionerRole derive from the core US profile.

# ===  These Profiles are used in the attachment requests examples Cdex Task Example 19, CDex Task Example 20 as a contained resources. ===

# ===  === These examples demonstrate DocumentReference Payloads for an operation. The actual content is inline base64 encoded data. Since the narrative would be the human-readable metadata about the document which is easily parsed, we think it add little value for the cost of adding it. === ===

Constraint failed: dom-6: 'A resource should have narrative for robust management' (defined in http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/DomainResource) (Best Practice Recommendation)

Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# === The profile definitions conform to 3 versions of US Core Practitioner via `meta.profile'. This warning means the examples matches all of them, which is the intent.  Listing of all US conformant US Core profiles is an alternative to creating a single CDex Profile for Patient and Practitioner (or choosing a single US Core Profile) that conforms to  all three US Core versions.  We chose this option because it is direct (vs indirection) and thus easier to understand.  See related chat: https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/channel/179252-IG-creation/topic/multiple.20version.20of.20IG.20in.20meta.20profile.20warning ===
