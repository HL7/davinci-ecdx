# CDex needs a contained patient for 3 specific demographic elements- US Core variance approved: http://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-37738
WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-cdex/StructureDefinition/cdex-patient-demographics').baseDefinition: US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Patient derive from the core US profile

# CDex needs a contained PractitionerRole to communicate the identifiers for both the provider practitioner and organization using Task.owner which is limited to max=1 reference. A Jira ticket has been lodged for Task to allow for >1 task.for element to address this issue.  This is the appropriate use of contained because the content referred to in the contained resource does not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains it.  Furthermore, US Core does not require but recommends that contained resource conform to US Core.  US Core variance approved: https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-39618

# Thes example demonstrates DocumentReference Payloads for an operation. The actual content is inline base64 encoded data. Since the narrative would be the human-readable metadata about the document which is easily parsed, we think it add little value for the cost of adding it.
