# ===  CDex needs a contained patient for 3 specific demographic elements US Core variance approved: https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-46780 ===

WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-cdex/StructureDefinition/cdex-patient-demographics').baseDefinition: US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Patient derive from the core US profile. See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CGP/US+Core+Variance+Request+Process

# ===  CDex needs a contained PractitionerRole to communicate the identifiers for both the provider practitioner and organization using Task.owner which is limited to max=1 reference. A Jira ticket has been lodged for Task to allow for >1 task.for element to address this issue.  This is the appropriate use of contained because the content referred to in the contained resource does not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains it.  Furthermore, US Core does not require but recommends that contained resource conform to US Core.  US Core variance approved: https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-46779 ===

# ===  === These examples demonstrate DocumentReference Payloads for an operation. The actual content is inline base64 encoded data. Since the narrative would be the human-readable metadata about the document which is easily parsed, we think it add little value for the cost of adding it. === ===

Constraint failed: dom-6: 'A resource should have narrative for robust management' (defined in http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/DomainResource) (Best Practice Recommendation)


# ===  === These examples use example.org code system to show how translations ( i.e. local codes) could be used in addition to standard code systems. === ===

# ===  === These examples uses example.org to reference a base questionnaire URI from which it is derived to code system to demonstrate the structure not the content === ===

# ===  The Da Vinci Team is aware of this plans to move them in a future publication cycle ===

Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# ==== Since FMG approval for publication, the latest ig-publisher emits a new warning about a deprecation slicing pattern.  We will correct it in the next release. See this chat: https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/channel/179252-IG-creation/topic/deprecated.20pattern.20slicing ===

The discriminator type 'pattern' has been deprecated. Use type=fixed with a pattern[x] instead
