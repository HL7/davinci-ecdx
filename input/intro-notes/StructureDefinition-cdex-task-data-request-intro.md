<!-- StructureDefinition-cdex-task-data-request-intro.md -->

Although the CDex Task Data Request Profile is based upon the [Da Vinci HRex Task Data Request](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-hrex/StructureDefinition/hrex-task-data-request), this profile is technically non-conformant with it because of the questionnaire input parameter. Therefore, the CDex made a change request [FHIR-39686](https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-39686) to update the HRex Profile, and after published updates to the HRex profile, future versions of this profile will derive from it.
