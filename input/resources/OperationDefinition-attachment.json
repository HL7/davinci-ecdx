    "description": "This operation is used to submit attachments for Claims or Prior Authorization. This operation accepts the clinical attachments and the necessary information needed to re-attach them to the claim or prior authorization, and returns a transaction layer http response.  This operation can be used by any HTTP end-point, not just FHIR RESTful servers.\n\nThe input parameters are:\n1. One or more Attachments as FHIR Resources\n1. Data elements for reassociation to the Claim/Prior Authorization\n    - Reason for Attachments:\n      - Unsolicited attachments for a claim\n      - Solicited attachments for a claim\n      - Additional information for prior authorization\n    - A unique claim/prior authorization identifier\n    - One or more unique claim line item identifiers\n    - A unique organization/location identifier (e.g., NPI)\n    - A unique provider identifier (e.g., NPI)\n    - A unique Patient member identifier\n\nThere are no output parameters.\n\nNote that Unsolicited Claim implies that the *provider* assigns the claim identifier (in other words, a \"placer identifier\") upon claim generation. Solicited Claim and Prior Authorization imply that the *payer* assigned the Claim/Prior Authorization identifier (in other words, a \"filler identifier\") a upon receipt of a claim or prior authorization.\n",

    "comment": "The following rules apply when using `$attachment`:\n* The operation only accepts `POST` transactions - any other HTTP method will result in an HTTP error\n* When processing messages, a server may return one of several status codes:\n  * **200 OK**: Indicates that the operation has been processed.\n  * **202 Accepted**: Indicates that the receiving system has accepted custody\n  of the message\n  * **4xx**: Indicates some error in the submission. The client **SHOULD** interpret a 4xx response to indicate that there is no point resubmitting the unaltered message,\n  * **5xx**: Indicates some system error. The client **SHOULD** interpret a 5xx response to indicate an unexpected error occurred on the part of the server, with the implication that it may be appropriate to resubmit the original message.\n  *  The server **MAY** return an [OperationOutcome](http://hl7.org/fhir/operationoutcome.html) with additional information, and **SHOULD** do so if the response code is 400 or greater.\n",
