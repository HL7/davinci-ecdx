### Overview

#### What do Payers do with clinical information?

Augment claims data to satisfy quality reporting requirements and improve quality care scores, and to reduce preventable medical errors

#### When does Payer need this clinical information?

Minimum 2x per year, sometimes monthly. More frequent info would help improve scores.

#### Who does the information come from/who is asked?

Can come from any provider. Typically outpatient providers. Directly from network providers. A combination of claims and clinical info. May use HIE’s if available to Payers. (Some auditing issues when getting data from an HIEs--more work required for proper attestation.)

#### What information is needed?

Medical records, a progress note or visit summary, C-CDA’s of various types, but more oriented toward data points. Medications, lab results, Assessment for Diagnoses, vital signs (BP). Narrative (clinical notes).

### Example Use case

Payers review member information to identify gaps in care. They work with providers and hunt down information showing the gap in care has been closed. Improving HEDIS measure scores has a positive impact on revenue for payers and reimbursements for providers.

Clinical data, especially that which is not typically found in health plan claims, creates a more accurate picture of each member’s health. This is turn allows payers to more accurately assess quality of care. For example, if a member had a double mastectomy years before starting coverage with their current health plan, the payer may not know that member no longer needs to receive a mammogram. Without the additional clinical data of the members mastectomy, the payer would show the lack of recent mammogram as an open care gap and may engage the member in an effort to close a gap that really doesn’t exist. Care quality assessment measures would be improved if health plan quality management programs had accurate data about each member’s health status.
