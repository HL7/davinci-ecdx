### Overview

#### What do Payers do with clinical information?

Create a complete clinical record to improve care coordination and provide optimum medical care (e.g. reduce redundant care, in order to shift to more proactive/timely care, make better informed, more accurate medical treatment recommendations.

#### When does Payer need this clinical information?

Always looking to find new conditions or a change in status regarding the existing conditions (based on HCC model) (regular data feeds is better)

#### Who does the information come from/who is asked?

Needs to come from many/all providers, but typically from outpatient providers and usually from network providers. May use HIE’s if available to Payers.

#### What information is needed?

Medical records, a progress note or visit summary. C-CDA’s of various types (information supporting care planning). Medications, lab results, Assessment for Diagnoses, vital signs (BP). Narrative (clinical notes).

### Example Use case

Some payers create a complete clinical record for each of their members to facilitate data exchange with providers. Payers use this clinical record to give providers the adequate information to execute care coordination decisions.
...

They also use clinical information gathered from providers to support the HEDIS/Stars quality program. For example, by examining the record for care coordination information they may improve performance on the HEDIS TRC- Transitions of Care measure which looks at 1) notification of inpatient admission, 2) receipt of discharge information, 3) patient engagement after inpatient discharge and 4) medication reconciliation post-discharge.
