### Overview

#### What do Payers do with clinical information?

Improve processes between the payer and provider so member has fewer issues-less waiting, better planning/cost information) Allows the payer to have a more informed conversation with the member.

#### When does Payer need this clinical information?

Real-time/ongoing, closely tied to the point of care. This isn’t “another ask”, its about using the existing information to make processes run more smoothly.

#### Who does the information come from/who is asked?

From the provider ordering or providing services. Supporting documentation from consulting providers may be required. (Patient information can flow into provider systems, direct collection of Patient info is out of scope.)

#### What information is needed?

Information that helps a payer improve care management. Uses information gathered for other purposes. Info that helps provider greater transparency to the process.  Treatment information that payers want to be able to support sharing with patients.

### Example Use case

Payers need information that helps them meet new regulatory requirements that promote patient access and exchange of information.

Clinical data, especially that which is not typically found in health plan claims, creates a more complete picture of the members health. This is turn allows payers to more accurately target member outreach. For example, if a member had a double mastectomy years before starting coverage with their current health plan, the payer may not know that member no longer needs to receive a mammogram. Without the additional clinical data of the members mastectomy, the payer may engage the member in an effort to remind patients to schedule an annual mammogram. Inappropriate outreach may make a member feel as if his or her health plan doesn’t have accurate information about their health. Member experience would be improved if member engagement was tailored to each patient’s health status.
