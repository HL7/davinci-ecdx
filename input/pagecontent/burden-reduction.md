In [Da Vinci Prior Authorization Support (PAS)], the expectation is that a final decision is generated immediately and automatically in the majority of cases.  The flow below depicts the cases where the result is "pended" and additional data is needed.  In these cases, the Payer or Provider may elect to use a CDex Transaction submit attachments.  The flow sheets diagrams below illustrate where in the PAS workflow the Provider could use CDex to submit attachments.
