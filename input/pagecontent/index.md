### About This Guide

This Implementation Guide is supported by the [Da Vinci] initiative which is a private effort to accelerate the adoption of Health Level Seven International Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (HL7® FHIR®) as the standard to support and integrate value-based care (VBC) data exchange across communities. Like all Da Vinci Implementation Guides, it follows the [HL7 Da Vinci Guiding Principles] for exchange of patient health information.  The guide is based upon the prior work from the [US Core] and [Da Vinci Health Record Exchange (HRex)] Implementation Guides. Changes to this specification are managed by the sponsoring HL7 [Patient Care (PC)] workgroup and are incorporated as part of the standard HL7 balloting process. You can suggest changes to this specification by creating a *change request tracker* by clicking on the [Propose a Change] link at the bottom of any page.
