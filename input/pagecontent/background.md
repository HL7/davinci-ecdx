### About the Da Vinci Project

Da Vinci is a private sector initiative that addresses the needs of the Value Based Care Community by leveraging the HL7 FHIR platform.  For more information about the Da Vinci Project, its use cases, members and updates, see the [Da Vinci Overview]

### What do Payers do with clinical information?

Payers want to create a complete clinical record of their members to improve care coordination and provide optimum medical care. For example with this information they can reduce redundant care, shift to a more proactive and timely care, and make better informed and more accurate medical treatment and care planning recommendations.  Improve processes between the payer and provider improves member experience.  The member has fewer issues, such as shorter wait times and better planning/cost information. It allows the payer to have a more informed conversation with the member.

Payers also require clinical data from the provider ordering or providing services to document prior authorization, claims processing, audit submitted claims, to confirm medical necessity and appropriateness.  Clinical data is also used by Payers to create complete, accurate risk profiles for members for value-based care contracts and population health adjustments. Quality reporting requirements and quality care scoring all require clinical data. Importantly, this data helps to reduce preventable medical errors.  Payers review member information to identify gaps in care. They work with providers and hunt down information showing the gap in care has been closed. Improving HEDIS measure scores has a positive impact on revenue for payers and reimbursements for providers.

### What information is needed?

A sampling of the type of information needed by Payers includes:

- Medical records - for example, a progress note or visit summary
- C-CDAâ€™s of various types
- Medications
- Laboratory results
- Clinical Assessments for Diagnoses
- Vital Signs - for example Blood Pressure measurements
- Narrative - such as written or transcribed clinical notes


### Where Does CDEX Fit in the Da Vinci Project?

There are over a dozen use cases and corresponding Implementation guides being developed by the Da Vinci Project.  This guide provide technical guidance to support the exchange of clinical data generated by providers to be shared with payers (or other providers).  Figure 1 illustrates how the Clinical Data Exchange (CDex) use case fits in the family of Da Vinci Use Cases/Implementation Guides.

#### Example Scenarios

- Some payers create a complete clinical record for each of their members to facilitate data exchange with providers. Payers use this clinical record to give providers the adequate information to execute care coordination decisions.

- Clinical information gathered from providers to support the HEDIS/Stars quality program. <!--For example, by examining the record for care coordination information they may improve performance on the HEDIS TRC- Transitions of Care measure which looks at 1) notification of inpatient admission, 2) receipt of discharge information, 3) patient engagement after inpatient discharge and 4) medication reconciliation post-discharge.-->

- Payers need information that helps them meet new regulatory requirements that promote patient access and exchange of information.

- A Durable Medical Equipment supplier submits a claim for a wheelchair. The Payer reviews the claim and assesses that the documentation submitted by the Provider is insufficient to support medical necessity or Payer coverage rules.

- Payers need to provide CMS with Risk Adjustment submissions annually.

### Workflow Overview

See the [Specification] page for a detailed description of the technical workflow and API guidance.

Figure 2 below illustrates the general workflow for the exchange of clinical data between a Payer system and a Provider system.

{% include img.html img="image2020-9-25_14-15-22.png" caption="Figure 2" %}

#### Actors and Roles:

- The Payer system (Payer) acts in the role of a *data consumer*
- The Provider system (Provider) acts in the role of a *data source*

#### Steps
1. The Payer system initiates a request for clinical information
1. The Provider system retrieves the the requested data.
1. The data may be review by the provider prior to sending back to the Payer system
1. The data is sent back to the Payer system

#### Provider to Provider

This project scope includes exchanges of clinical information between provider and other providers.  However, this use case has not been sufficiently explored and tested to provide guidance in this version of the guide.
