### About the Da Vinci Project

Da Vinci is a private sector initiative that addresses the needs of the Value Based Care Community by leveraging the HL7 FHIR platform.  For more information about the Da Vinci Project, its use cases, members and updates, see the [Da Vinci Overview]

### What Do Payers Do with Clinical Information?

Payers want to create a clinical record of their members to improve care coordination and provide optimum medical care. For example with this information they can reduce redundant care, shift to more proactive and timely care, and make better informed and more accurate medical treatment and care planning recommendations. Payers may use this clinical record to give providers information that may assist in care coordination.

Payers also require clinical data from the provider ordering or providing services to document prior authorization, claims processing, audit submitted claims, to confirm medical necessity and appropriateness.  Clinical data is used by Payers to create risk profiles for members for value-based care contracts and population health adjustments. Quality reporting requirements and quality care scoring all require clinical data for evaluating clinical performance and outcomes.

#### Example Scenarios

- Payer requests *attachments* to support a claim submission.

- Payer requests *attachments* to support medical necessity or a coverage rule.

- Payer requests *attachments* to support a claims audit.

- Payer requests additional information for prior authorization.  (See the [Da Vinci - Prior Authorization Support] for more information)

- Payer requests patient health record information to support a HEDIS/Stars quality program. <!--For example, by examining the record for care coordination information they may improve performance on the HEDIS TRC- Transitions of Care measure which looks at 1) notification of inpatient admission, 2) receipt of discharge information, 3) patient engagement after inpatient discharge and 4) medication reconciliation post-discharge.-->

- Payer requests patient health record information to support their Risk Adjustment submissions to CMS.

- Payer requests patient health record information to support their member records. (Some payers create a clinical record for each of their members to facilitate data exchange with providers. Payers use this clinical record to give providers the adequate information to execute care coordination decisions.)

- Payers requests patient health record information to meet new regulatory requirements (e.g., promoting patient access)

### Provider to Provider Data Exchange

 Providers commonly need and request information from other providers about their patients.  For example, when referring a patient, the referred-to provider needs the order and supporting documentation and the referring provider needs the results from the referral.  Although this guide focuses on payor to provider to interactions, the technical exchange is no different than a provider to provider interaction.

#### Example Scenario

 - Referred-to provider solicits additional clinical information from referring provider to support performing the requested service.
</div>

### What Information is Needed?

A sampling of the type of information needed by Payers includes:

- Medical records - for example, a progress note or visit summary
- C-CDAâ€™s of various types
- Medications
- Laboratory results
- Clinical Assessments for Diagnoses
- Vital Signs - for example Blood Pressure measurements
- Narrative - such as written or transcribed clinical notes

### Where Does CDEX Fit in the Da Vinci Project?

There are over a dozen use cases and corresponding Implementation guides being developed by the Da Vinci Project.  Figure 1 illustrates how the Clinical Data Exchange (CDex) use case fits in the family of Da Vinci Use Cases/Implementation Guides.  CDex is not intended to supplant existing standards that already define how to share clinical information. <span markdown='1' class="bg-success">This guide provides technical guidance to support the exchange of clinical data generated by providers to be shared with payers (or other providers). It can be used when there are not other implemented standards to manage that process. For example, when auditing a claim, CDex can be used by a Payer to confirm medical necessity.</span>

### Workflow Overview

See the [Specification] page for a detailed description of the technical workflow and API guidance.

Figure 2 below illustrates the general workflow for the exchange of clinical data between a Payer (or Provider) system and a Provider system.

{% include img.html img="workflow-overview.svg" caption="Figure 2" %}

#### Actors and Roles

- The Payer or External Provider System acts in the role of a *data consumer*.
- The Provider system acts in the role of a *data source*.\*
- A human practitioner involved in approving/filtering the information provided.
  - A pre-existing agreement could be in place that allows data to be shared *without* human intervention.

\* For most payer use-cases, payers can not use the data if they cannot identify who is responsible for the clinical event (for example an observation, diagnosis, order, etc).  Therefore, payer's health records needs to identify the provider who is making the assertion. This information is typically supplied by provider systems.  An *Electronic Health Information Exchange* (HIE) that has the ability to validate the authorship of the information would also be an acceptable data source.  However, not all HIEs do this (and not for all records) and they would *not* be acceptable data sources.

#### Steps
1. The data consumer initiates a request for clinical or administrative information.
1. The data source retrieves the the requested data.
1. The data may be reviewed by a human practitioner prior to sending it back to the data consumer.
1. The data is sent back to the the data consumer.
