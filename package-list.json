  "introduction": "The Da Vinci CDex implementation guide provides detailed guidance that helps implementers use FHIR-based interactions and resources relevant to scenarios associated with Provider exchange of clinical information with Payers. The IG covers six specific use cases that demonstrate how to exchange clinical data generated by Providers with Payers and other Providers to improve care coordination, support risk adjustment, ease quality management, facilitate claims auditing and confirm medical necessity, improve member experience, and support orders and referrals. It supplies guidance on how to reuse existing profiles fit for this type of exchange and provides additional profiles and guidance to  address the requirements not covered by existing Implementation Guides and profiles.",
