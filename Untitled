        Some questions on an SDOH screening questionnaire are not answered
        directly (e.g., asserted) by the individual completing the
        questionnaire. Rather, the answer to some questions (e.g., the Hunger
        Vital Sign 88124-3 “Food insecurity risk”) may be derived from answers
        to one or more other questions. For a Screening Response Observation
        that is derived, as opposed to answered directly, Observation.performer
        should not be specified and Observation.derivedFrom should reference the
        relevant Screening Response Observation(s).

        "Null" or exceptional values can be represented two ways in FHIR
        Observations.  One way is to simply include them in the value set and
        represent the exceptions in the value.  The alternate way is to use the
        value element for actual observations and use the explicit
        dataAbsentReason element to record exceptional values. For a given LOINC
        question, if the LOINC answer list includes concepts such as 'unknown'
        or 'not available', they should be used for Observation.value. Where
        these concepts are not part of the value set for Observation.value, the
        Observation.dataAbsentReason can be used if necessary and appropriate.
